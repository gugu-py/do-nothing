That’s a fun and intriguing concept! Here’s a breakdown of the functions you'll need to implement for the "Nothing" website, along with their difficulty levels:

### Functions to Implement:

1. **Start Button Functionality**
   - **Description**: Initializes the timer when the user clicks the "Start" button.
   - **Difficulty**: Easy
   - **Details**: Set up a `useState` to manage the timer and a `useEffect` or similar mechanism to start the timer when the button is clicked.

2. **Timer Functionality**
   - **Description**: Keeps track of the elapsed time from when the user clicks "Start" until they interact with the page.
   - **Difficulty**: Medium
   - **Details**: Use `setInterval` or `setTimeout` to increment the timer and manage the state. Make sure to clean up intervals when necessary.

3. **Detect User Interaction**
   - **Description**: Detects any mouse movement, keypresses, or clicks to stop the timer.
   - **Difficulty**: Medium
   - **Details**: Add event listeners for `mousemove`, `keydown`, and `click`. Use `useEffect` to add and clean up these event listeners.

4. **Stop Timer and Record Time**
   - **Description**: Stops the timer and records the total time when user interaction is detected.
   - **Difficulty**: Easy
   - **Details**: When any interaction is detected, clear the timer and save the elapsed time.

5. **Display Time and Ranking**
   - **Description**: Shows the total time spent and how it compares to other users' times.
   - **Difficulty**: Medium
   - **Details**: For simplicity, you might start with a local ranking system (e.g., saving times in local storage) or later use a server-side solution to keep track of global times.

6. **Store and Retrieve Rankings**
   - **Description**: Save user times and retrieve them to show rankings.
   - **Difficulty**: Medium to Hard (depends on persistence method)
   - **Details**: Use `localStorage` for simple persistence, or set up a backend service if you want to scale it to store global rankings.

7. **Reset Timer and Rankings**
   - **Description**: Provide an option to reset the timer and possibly clear or reset rankings.
   - **Difficulty**: Easy
   - **Details**: Implement a reset button to clear the timer and possibly the stored rankings.

8. **UI/UX Design**
   - **Description**: Create an intuitive and engaging user interface for the website.
   - **Difficulty**: Medium
   - **Details**: Design a layout that clearly shows the timer, start button, and results. Consider adding styling and animations to enhance user experience.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Error Handling**: Ensure your app handles errors gracefully (e.g., if the timer function fails).
- **Performance**: Optimize performance to ensure the app runs smoothly and efficiently.
- **Accessibility**: Make sure the website is accessible to all users, including those using screen readers or other assistive technologies.

### Summary of Difficulty Levels:

- **Easy**: Start Button Functionality, Stop Timer and Record Time, Reset Timer and Rankings.
- **Medium**: Timer Functionality, Detect User Interaction, Display Time and Ranking, UI/UX Design.
- **Medium to Hard**: Store and Retrieve Rankings (depending on persistence method).
